# Corpus v1

This corpus is 1738 texts big that were scraped from Gutenberg, Zeno and the DTA. This texts are not intended for close reading, as in some cases the layout was not preserved (especially with the zeno.org files).

The texts were cleaned with the CAB-tool of the DTA. Stopwords were extracted with the spaCy de_core_news_lg of the cleaned texts.
